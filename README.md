# Customer Support Analysis

Customer Support Analysis
This project, aims to uncover insights from customer support ticket data to improve service quality, response times, and overall customer satisfaction. By analyzing ticket trends, product issues, and support performance, we strive to identify areas for improvement and understand customer needs better.

Below is the structure of this repository, which is organized into several key folders and files:

- `DataSets/`: Contains the raw and processed data used in the analysis. This includes customer support ticket logs, product information, and any other relevant datasets.

- `Results/`: This folder holds the final analysis reports, visualizations, and any generated output files that summarize our findings. These materials are designed to be accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

- `CSAT.pbix`: A Power BI Desktop file containing interactive reports and dashboards that visualize the customer satisfaction and support performance metrics.

- `CSAT.pdf`: A static PDF version of the analysis report, suitable for distribution, printing, or offline review.
